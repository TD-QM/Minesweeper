# Minesweeper
Customizable minesweeper. Able to adjust the number of rows, columns, and mines on the field.

Made this early 2022, at the ending of my senior year of highschool when I needed a project for the AP Comp Sci P Exam. Not entirely sure why I even took that course. I already had Software Design I credit from AP Comp Sci A, so it didn't even do anything if I got the highest possible score. Just kind of re-hashed an old game. Got a 5 on both AP Exams, if that's at all interesting. Probably not haha.
